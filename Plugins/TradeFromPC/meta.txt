 # ================================ Overview ================================ #
# Simplify the trading process in your Pokémon Essentials game by enabling direct trading from the Pokémon Storage, 
# eliminating the need to access your party. This script streamlines 
# trading, making it more efficient and user-friendly.
# 
#==============================================================================#
#===============================V1.01 Changes==================================#
#==============================================================================#

 # ============================ Trade Initiation ============================ #
	# ========= To initiate a trade, use the following command ========= #
# pbChoosePokemonForTradePC(:RATTATA)
# The parameter (:RATTATA) represents the Pokémon symbol that the trader is seeking.
# Changed the way the initial is called. It now requires less arugments.
# Faster to type and less of a chance of error.
#
 # ========================== Completing the Trade ========================== #
		# ===== Execute the trade using the following command ===== #
# pbStartTradePC(:HAUNTER, _I("HaHa"), _I("Andrea"), 1)
# The first parameter (:HAUNTER) specifies the Pokémon symbol that the trader will exchange with you.
# The second parameter (_I("HaHa")) is the nickname for the Pokémon you'll receive in the trade.
# The third parameter (_I("Andrea")) represents the name of the trader conducting the trade with you.
# The fourth parameter (1) indicates the trader's gender (0 for male, 1 for female).
#
# Changed the way the initial is called. It now requires less arugments.
# Faster to type and less of a chance of error.
#
# ========================== Imporant Additions ========================== #
# I have removed the needed for the old first parameter. It now starts with the Pokemon.
# Also, it's now written to accept just one argument, if wanted.
# If you want to use the short form version call with:
# pbStartTradePC(:HAUNTER)
# This will start the trade where Haunter is the Pokemon coming to you. 
# The Nickname value will default to the Pokemon's original name.
# The Trainer name will default to whatever the event's name is within the map. If your NPC Trader is named "Gent" (in the example situation),
# leaving it blank will result in the Pokemon's trainer name being "Gent".
# The Trainer gender is defaulted to male(0). 
# If you want to change a certain section of the arguments, for instance the Trainer gender, but nothing else, you would have to put "nil" for the other arguments.
# I.E. pbStartTradePC(:HAUNTER, nil, nil, 1)
# This would trade you a Haunter, with Nickname Haunter, from NPC "Event Name", with a trainer gender of female.
# 
# Another example would be if you wanted to just change the nickname of the Pokemon.
# I.E. pbStartTradePC(:HAUNTER, "Boo")
# Since you only wanted to change the second argument, you don't have to continue with the third and fourth, as they're optional.
#

#
# Old Method: Ignore for the most part. Only here for reference purposes.
 # ============================ Trade Initiation ============================ #
	# ========= To initiate a trade, use the following command ========= #
# pbChoosePokemonForTradePC(1, 2, :RATTATA)
# The first parameter (1) designates where the selected Pokémon will be stored as a game variable. You can customize this variable as needed.
# The second parameter (2) stores the Pokémon's name as a game variable.
# The third parameter (:RATTATA) represents the Pokémon symbol that the trader is seeking.
#
#
 # ========================== Completing the Trade ========================== #
		# ===== Execute the trade using the following command ===== #
# pbStartTradePC(pbGet(1), :HAUNTER, _I("HaHa"), _I("Andrea"), 1)
# The first parameter (pbGet(1)) retrieves the information stored in game variable 1, ensuring consistency with the variable used during trade initiation.
# The second parameter (:HAUNTER) specifies the Pokémon symbol that the trader will exchange with you.
# The third parameter (_I("HaHa")) is the nickname for the Pokémon you'll receive in the trade.
# The fourth parameter (_I("Andrea")) represents the name of the trader conducting the trade with you.
# The fifth parameter (1) indicates the trader's gender (0 for male, 1 for female).
